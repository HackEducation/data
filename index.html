<p>As part of my research, I track many aspects of the education technology industry. My data is freely and openly available and is hosted on GitHub. This means you are welcome to download or fork each repository, as well as to contribute feedback or file issues. (Clearly some of these data sets are more complete than others. Don't complain about it. Make an update.)</p>
